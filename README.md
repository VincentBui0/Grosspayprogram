# Grosspayprogram
This program was used with C++, Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server. Upon running the program on Visual Studio, it connects with Microsoft SQL Server in order to make it possible to open up a database.
It's computing a Windows search file with the database InventorySQL from Microsoft SQL Server. 
In this program, upon running the program it opens up a window in which the user must open a database before doing anything else. 
After doing so, the user can type out a certain food item that can only be found in the database, otherwise clicking “Search” does nothing. 
If a food item is typed correctly from the database, such as “Cherry” or “Coconut” like above, it prints out information about the item. 
This information includes its ID, item name, department, quantity, unit cost, inventory cost and lastly the item’s image. The inventory cost is calculated by multiplying the quantity and unit cost together.
